# MetroMap visualizations for Self Organizing Maps

> NOTE: The .ipynb notebook has to be started from a [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) session, a normal Jupyter Notebook won't be able to show the [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) [FigureWidgets](https://plotly.com/python/figurewidget/) correctly.

## Prerequisites

After installing the dependencies listed in the _requirements.txt_ file, one also has to install and enable the Plotly Jupyter Lab extensions. For more info see the official [documentation](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#jupyterlab-support-python-35). As of the time of writing Plotly does not yet support Jupyter Lab version 3+. We'll update this README once support for version 3+ has arrived in the stable channel.
